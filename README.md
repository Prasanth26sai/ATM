Our funathon project is about POLYNOMIAL OPERATIONS(USING DATA STRUCTURES)
Here the user can select the coefficient and power of their choice.
A polynomial can be thought of as an ordered list of non zero terms. Each non zero term is a two-tuple which holds two pieces of information: 
The exponent part 
The coefficient part
Here we perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and deletion.linked list is a data structure that stores each element as an object in a node of the list. every note contains two parts data han and links to the next node. Polynomial is a mathematical expression that consists of variables and coefficients.
In a linked list representation, the addition operation is easier to perform because the two polynomials represented by the linked lists are arranged in descending order.
