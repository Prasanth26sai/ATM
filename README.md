In Java, we can create an ATM program for representing ATM transactions. In the ATM program, the user has to select an option from the options displayed on the screen. The options are related to withdrawing the money, depositing the money, checking the balance, and exiting. We use the exit(0) method to exit from the current Transaction mode and return the user to the home page or initial screen.
